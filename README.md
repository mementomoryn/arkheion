# Arkheion (WIP)

_**Ever feel annoyed of missing songs you once liked because it's removed from music streaming services?**_

Rest assured, **Arkheion** support downloading from various music streaming services.

**Arkheion** collects multiple python scripts to download songs, albums, and even playlists in the best quality.

With **Arkheion**, you can easily download favorite songs you wanted to archive.

Why use **Arkheion** instead of running the scripts directly in your device:
- Entirely ran with GitHub Actions virtual environments, so it's really fast.
- Provide a simple GUI, so it's much easier to use.
- Downloads is uploaded as GitHub Artifacts, allows to share your downloaded songs with just a link.
- Works in practically every devices, as long as it could invoke GitHub Actions workflows
